    <h3>My Birth</h3>
    <p>When I was born, I was dropped 16 times, and on the 17th time, I grew enough brain cells back to scream at my parents for being so callous with their child and put me in my stroller.</p>

    <h3>What Happened Next?</h3>
    <p>I fought tooth and nail to escape the hospital.  “For fonem’s grave!” I screamed this multiple times, fighting my way out. “Stroller 3 down!” I heard over the comm system. God dammit, I said to myself.  We couldn’t continue at this rate. “We need to resupply at the formula factory,” I radioed over the mic. “GGAAAHH-” said stroller 4, and I knew we were down on numbers yet again. We fought valiantly but our time had come.</p>

        May we remember them in our hearts.
